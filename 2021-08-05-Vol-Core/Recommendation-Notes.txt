Action items: Engl 355 -- nuke for 360.   Put to the faculty.

WC for CpE & EE:
   - Modify junior seminar for writing (summaries of presentations).
   - Try for 401 -- will be difficult.
   - Try for 335, since multiple professors require lab writeups.
   - Add a lab section for 335 and get WC for that.
   - Tell the students to take Jane Austen.

OC - Try for 401 (perhaps adding a credit)
     Create a course.
     Leave it to the students.

AOC - Try for 402.

EI  * Just let the students get it on their own.
      (Philosophy: wait and see with this part of VolCore).
    - Simplest would be ECE 335 and COSC 340.  Then majors get all three EI's.
    - Or ECE 336 (EE), ECE 351 (CpE), COSC 340.
    - Other thought is put some in electives and if students don't take them,
      then they get it with general electives (AH, SS, etc).

    Potential courses:  
       ECE 335 perhaps. COSC 340.  COSC 365.  ECE 351.  COSC 469.  ECE 469.
       Plenty of 400 level CS.

QR: - Do only 100 and 111 is our recommendation
    - There is an argument for 101.  JSP doesn't like it.

Side note -- Leon to spur faculty into looking into EE program.

To look into: Power Concentration -- can we get rid of it, or turn it into a minor?
      Also: Make Cybersecurity more accessible make it explicit how to get the 
            minor.  Scott/Stella/Doowon -- remove 360 prereq for 366 so that it's
            easier to get for non-majors.

      Remind faculty of what the words "minor" and "concentration" really mean at UT.

- Formal T/T oversight of courses taught primarily by non T/T faculty.
- Or: Getting consistency on courses taught by multiple faculty.
- Mapping of topics to courses.  Force faculty to do this.
    - Use ABET as a starting point.
    - SharePoint files for each class as resources.
    - Make this a point of collaboration between us and assessment.
