# Undergraduate Committee Items for the Next Faculty Meeting

August 9, 2021.

Committee: James Plank (chair), Leon Tolbert, Nicole McFarlane, Garrett Rose, Scott Ruoti, Jian Liu.

## VolCore

*Summary*: VolCore is the new general eduction requirements that will start in the
2022-2023 school year.  There is no carry-over from the previous gen-ed, so all classes
that were previously approved as gen-ed have to reapply for VolCore status.  Moreover,
all majors have to modify their catalogs to satisfy the VolCore requirements.
If you care to see information about VolCore, please see

--------
### Summary of VolCore Requirements and how they affect EECS

VolCore breaks up their requirements into three categories:

1. *Effective Communication*: Five courses:
    - Freshman English (two courses): No change for us.
    - An additional *Written Communication* (WC) designated course:
      We currently use English 355/360 for COSC, and ECE 401
      for CpE/EE.  Please see discussion and recommendations below.
    - An additional *Oral Communication* (OC) designated course:
      We currently use COSC/ECE 402 for this.  Please see discussion and recommendations below.
    - An additional *Applied Oral Communication* (AOC) designated course.
      This is a new requirement.  
      Please see discussion and recommendations below.

2. *Expanded Perspectives"* 10 courses:
    - Really no change from before.  The bottom line is that our students get "Natural Sciences"
      (NS) and "Quantitative Reasoning" (QR) as part of the majors.  That leaves six electives,
      the same number as before.
    - Some of the electives have changed names and requirements:
    - One "Arts & Humanities": (AH)
    - One "Social Sciences": (SS)
    - One "Global Citizenship: International Focus": (GCI)
    - One "Global Citizenship: US Focus": (GCUS)
    - Two more chosen from AH, SS, GCI or GCUS
    - *Requirement*: No class can count for more than one Expanded Perspective.  However, a
      class can count for an Expanded Perspective and WC/OC/AOC or EI (below).
    - We currently have QR status for COSC 100 and 102.  Please see the recommendations
      and discussion below about this.

3. *Engaged Inquiries*: 3 courses
    - This is a new VolCore requirement
    - Course has learning outcomes from at least two of the following:
    - Integrative or Multidisciplinary Knowledge
    - Applied Learning
    - Collaborative Learning
    - Reflective Development.
    - All three courses cannot have the same prefix (e.g. ECE).
    - Please see the discussion below

### Bottom Line on EECS

- We need to figure out a WC course.
- We need to figure out an OC course.
- We need to figure out an AOC course.
- We need to figure out options for the three EI courses.

--------------
# Recommendations from the Undergraduate Committee

- For WC, leave COSC alone (English 355/360).  For CpE and EE, apply to get WC status for
  ECE 395 (Junior Seminar).  Have the students write summaries of the presentations.  It will
  have the added benefit of making the students pay better attention!
- For OC, we apply for COSC/ECE 401, and perhaps add an extra credit to the course.
- For AOC, we apply for COSC/ECE 402.
- For EI, we do nothing, as students will get 2 or 3 with EF courses, and can get the third
  from one of the other electives.
- For QR, we apply for COSC 100 and COSC 111.

--------------
# Action Items

- Committee Member 1 will work with professors to get WC status for ECE 395.
- Committee Member 2 will work with professors to get OC status for COSC/ECE 401.
- Committee Member 3 will work with professors to get AOC status for COSC/ECE 402.
- Committee Member 4 will work with professors to get QR status for COSC 100.
- Committee Member 5 will work with professors to get QR status for COSC 111.
- Plank will coordinate work and do all catalog related modifications.
