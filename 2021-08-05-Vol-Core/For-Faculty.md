## VolCore

*Summary*: VolCore is the new general eduction requirements that will start in the
2022-2023 school year.  There is no carry-over from the previous gen-ed, so all classes
that were previously approved as gen-ed have to reapply for VolCore status.  Moreover,
all majors have to modify their catalogs to satisfy the VolCore requirements.
