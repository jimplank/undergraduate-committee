# Undergraduate Committee Files

This repo is where we will keep our files that we want to share with the public.
It includes notes for faculty meetings, catalog changes, etc, but also notes
from our meetings, so that they can be used by the assessment committee.

All of the files are kept in directories that are named by their dates and topics.
