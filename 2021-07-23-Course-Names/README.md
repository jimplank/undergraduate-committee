See the email from Margie Russell, and the xlsx files of names.  Here is a digesting of emails
from the faculty about this:

------

Ruoti:  think COSC 111 has a wonky transcript title. To me, it is unclear that this actually involves any programming. I think it would probably be better just as “The Art of Programming”, though I would argue the catalog title is also wonky (makes sense to CS people, probably not to anyone else).

Doug: Just a suggestion: drop the "real" from the DSP course (ECE 406).

Greg: Thanks for sending this out.  I only noticed one transcript title that might need to be tweaked.  ECE406 on real-time DSP is shortened to real DSP, and I think real-time should be included in the name.

Jens: Should CS202 not be *** I with CS302 being *** II? Likewise for any other similar sequence?

Andre/Gong/Jayne about 335/336: 

Andre: 
- ECE 335 should be called “Semiconductor Devices” from “Electronic Devices”.
- ECE 336 should be called “Microelectronic Circuits” or “Integrated Circuits” from “Electronic Circuits”.
- If there is an issue with naming 335 the same as 531 we can change 531 to “Solid-State Devices”.

Gong: ECE 335: Do we teach anything in this course about non-Si devices, e.g. LEDs, semiconductor lasers? If not, the word electronics defines the scope better: It's about devices for electronics, not photonics or optoelectronics; today's (active) electronic devices are (almost) all semiconductor devices anyway therefore nobody will suspect that we might be teaching about tubes. 

ECE 336: Is it exclusively about integrated circuits?  I have the impression that instructors like Ben may want to entertain some discrete bipolar transistor circuits.  Probably for better reasons than just fun? I guess the name "Electronic Circuits" is fine for such a basic course about all electronic circuits.  

Conclusion: Seems like we can agree on renaming 335 to Microelectronic devices and 336 to microelectronic circuits?
